# Practical Deep Learning Course

# Plan
* Focusing on hands-on practices, e.g., more coding than theoretical materials.
* Sessions of 3 hours each.
* Hackathon style: 
  * Hands-on coding is done inside the class
  * There should be no homework
  * Small and simple take-home practices
* Exercises use Python and Tensorflow.
